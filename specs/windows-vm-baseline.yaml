title: Windows VM baseline (placeholder)
status: draft
owner_agent: vmops
priority: low

problem_statement: |
  Windows VMs require external ISOs and virtio drivers that are not stored in git.
  We need a placeholder spec that documents required inputs and future tests.

scope:
  - Document required Windows ISO and virtio ISO paths
  - Define how external artifacts are referenced via .env

non_goals:
  - Implement Windows provisioning now

constraints:
  - Do not commit ISOs or drivers

assumptions:
  - External artifacts will be provided by the operator

interfaces:
  inputs:
    - WIN_ISO_PATH
    - VIRTIO_ISO_PATH
  outputs:
    - Documentation only

acceptance_tests:
  - name: TBD
    command: "TBD"
    expected: "TBD"

rollback:
  - None (placeholder spec)

security_considerations:
  - Do not store product keys in repo

artifacts_produced:
  - Placeholder spec only
